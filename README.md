# Pro Media Cropper v3.4

A professional-grade WordPress plugin for converting any media asset—including **PDFs, SVGs, and WebP**—into perfect 1920x1080 (16:9) images.

## 🚀 Key Features in v3.4

* **Smart Crop Modes:**
    * **Locked 16:9:** Forces the crop tool to maintain an HD aspect ratio.
    * **Pillarbox:** Allows free-form cropping. The plugin automatically fills the empty space to ensure the final output remains 16:9.
* **Contextual UI:** Pillarbox controls (Blur, Color, Eyedropper) automatically hide when in Locked mode to keep your workspace clean.
* **PDF to Image Engine:** Renders the first page of any PDF document into a high-resolution image locally in your browser.
* **Pro Pillarbox Styles:**
    * **Echo Blur:** Creates a cinematic blurred background from your image.
    * **Solid Colors:** Choose Black, White, or use the Eyedropper for a custom brand color.

## 🎨 How to use the "Crop Mode" Toggle

1. **Select Locked 16:9** if your source image is already horizontal and you just want to frame it perfectly.
2. **Select Pillarbox** if you have a vertical or square image (like a PDF document or a portrait photo). Use the **Pillarbox Style** dropdown to choose how you want to fill the "empty" sides of the 1080p frame.
3. Use the **Reset Crop** button next to the file selector if you need to snap the crop box back to its starting position without reloading the file.
